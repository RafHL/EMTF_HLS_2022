Purpose:
    The original purpose was to condense Jia Fu's arrays into smaller arrays
        organized to make PCS as generic as possible with regards to the zone
        boundaries. I am currently using this to get bit sizes, zone boundary
        array, and zone sizes for PCS with Jia Fu's new zones.

To use:
    ./zapp.out zone_host_converter/zone_host_converter_output.txt

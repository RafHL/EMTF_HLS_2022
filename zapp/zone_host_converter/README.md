Purpose:
    Converts the new host/zone layout to the previous method with EMTFZone and
        EMTFLayer for compatibility with ZAPP, who I use to make the zone
        boundaries for the PCS. Doing it this way means I can use the previously
        tested PCS modules with the new zones

To use:
    ./zone_host_conv.out 19_hosts.py 3_zones.py
